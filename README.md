# Windows Machine Learning Samples

This repo contains the Windows Machine Learning (WinML) samples that demonstrate how to build machine learning applications for Windows 10. 
We also have additional information and resources available here: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning

## API Samples

In the Samples directory, you will find samples that demonstrate API usage and specific features of Windows Machine Learning.
For example, the MNIST sample shows you how to use Visual Studio to easily generate the model interface for your application. The SnapCandy sample shows you how you can easily integrate your camera stream into your machine learning model.
